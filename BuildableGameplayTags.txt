		MassEntity # Flags an asset as spawning via MassEntity.
			Spline # Flags an asset as spawning via MassEntity with spline-directed movement when completed. Most likely declared at the Buildable Actor level.
				SkiChair # Spawns SkiChair entities, adhering to the ski chair boarding equation.
				Gondola # Spawns gondola entities.
			TransformSet # Flags an asset as spawning via MassEntity with Spawn locations given by a FSubMeshTransformSet. Declared at the Buildable Component level.
